# small-data-science-projects

This repo contains 3 small data science projects I worked on while learning the fundamentals of data science with Python.

1. The first code analyzes a wine quality dataset, where each row contains data on a wine sample, including several physicochemical properties gathered from tests, as well as a quality rating evaluated by wine experts.
2. The second is finding coding books published in the last 2 years using 2 datasets. It's a comparison between Numpy's in-build methods and set's methods to see which one is more time-efficient when it comes to certain tasks like this one.
3. Third, a list of holiday gifts is sorted based on their prices and then, the total estimated amount to be spent on those gifts is calculated. Again, 2 methods are used to determine which one works faster.
